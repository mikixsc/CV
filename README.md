## Information architecture
This project, designed as a single-page layout, organizes the CV sections in a logical, recruiter-friendly format.

At the top, a navigation bar provides direct access to key sections:
- About me 
- Education and Experience
- Skills and Languages
- Interests

Below this, the landing section introduces a brief personal profile with contact information, a short description, and a button to download the CV—allowing recruiters to access essential information immediately.

The following sections are arranged by importance, starting with About Me, where a centered text segment offers a concise description of me.

The Education and Experience section is presented in side-by-side columns, where items are organized chronologically.

In Skills and Languages, skills are displayed as rectangular cards that reveal a more detailed description upon hover. Languages are listed below, each with a progress bar indicating my level.

In the Interests section, each interest is visually separated with bordered elements for a clean, organized look.

Finally, the footer reinforces contact information and includes another CV download button, encouraging the recruiter to get in touch easily.

## Visual design

The color palette, inspired by the design tool [Paletton](https://paletton.com/), is centered on shades of blue to convey professionalism and trust. The project’s design primarily uses four colors:

- White
- Primary color: #0E2E5B
- Secondary color: #345689
- Accent color: #e8f1ff

Two fonts are used for readability and visual appeal:

- Secondary font: 'Roboto', sans-serif (for body text)

The combination provides a clean and visually pleasing design, with structured sections ordered by importance for easy navigation.
