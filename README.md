## Information architecture
This project, designed as a single-page layout, organizes CV sections in a logical, recruiter-friendly format that emphasizes readability and ease of navigation. The aim is to present information in a structured way, so recruiters can quickly access key details and gain a clear understanding of the candidate.

At the top of the page, a fixed navigation bar provides immediate access to key sections, each of which is organized to maximize visibility and impact:
- About me 
- Education and Experience
- Skills and Languages
- Interests

Below this, the landing section introduces a brief personal profile with contact information, a short description, and a button to download the CV—allowing recruiters to access essential information immediately. This setup allows recruiters to download and review the CV without navigating through the entire page if they prefer.

The following sections are arranged by importance, starting with About Me, where a centered text segment offers a concise description of me.

The Education and Experience section appears next, displayed in side-by-side columns to make efficient use of space. Each entry is listed chronologically, offering a clear timeline of accomplishments.

In the Skills and Languages section, individual skills are displayed as clickable rectangular cards. When hovered over, these cards reveal additional details, while language proficiency is indicated with progress bars to show skill levels visually.

The Interests section provides insight into personal hobbies and activities, with each interest separated by bordered elements, ensuring a clean and organized look.

Finally, the footer reinforces contact information and includes another CV download button, encouraging the recruiter to get in touch easily.

## Visual design

The color palette, inspired by the design tool [Paletton](https://paletton.com/), centers on various shades of blue, chosen to evoke a sense of professionalism, reliability, and trust. These cool blue tones create a visually cohesive and calm aesthetic, ideal for a CV or professional webpage, as blue is often associated with confidence. The design is built around four primary colors:
- White
- Primary color: #0E2E5B
- Secondary color: #345689, a softer blue that complements the primary color and is used in supporting elements to maintain visual consistency.
- Accent color: #e8f1ff, a light, airy blue that highlights certain areas, bringing attention to specific details without overwhelming the viewer.

Two fonts are used for readability and visual appeal:
- Primary font: 'Playfair Display', a serif font that is used for titles and headers, adding a touch of elegance and formality to the design.
- Secondary font: 'Roboto', a clean sans-serif font, used for body text to ensure clarity and ease of reading.

This combination of colors and fonts creates a organized layout that not only enhances the user experience but also supports easy navigation through structured sections arranged by importance. This thoughtful design ensures a polished, professional look that holds the viewer’s attention and reinforces the content’s clarity.
