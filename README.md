## Information architecture
This project, designed as a single-page layout, organizes the CV sections in a logical, recruiter-friendly format.

At the top, a navigation bar provides direct access to key sections:
- About me 
- Education and Experience
- Skills and Languages
- Interests

Below this, the landing section introduces a brief personal profile with contact information, a short description, and a button to download the CV—allowing recruiters to access essential information immediately.

The following sections are arranged by importance, starting with About Me, where a centered text segment offers a concise description of me.

The Education and Experience section is presented in side-by-side columns, where items are organized chronologically.

In Skills and Languages, skills are displayed as rectangular cards that reveal a more detailed description upon hover. Languages are listed below, each with a progress bar indicating my level.

In the Interests section, each interest is visually separated with bordered elements for a clean, organized look.

Finally, the footer reinforces contact information and includes another CV download button, encouraging the recruiter to get in touch easily.

## Visual design

The color palette, inspired by the design tool [Paletton](https://paletton.com/), centers on various shades of blue, chosen to evoke a sense of professionalism, reliability, and trust. These cool blue tones create a visually cohesive and calm aesthetic, ideal for a CV or professional webpage, as blue is often associated with confidence. The design is built around four primary colors:
- White
- Primary color: #0E2E5B
- Secondary color: #345689, a softer blue that complements the primary color and is used in supporting elements to maintain visual consistency.
- Accent color: #e8f1ff, a light, airy blue that highlights certain areas, bringing attention to specific details without overwhelming the viewer.

Two fonts are used for readability and visual appeal:
- Primary font: 'Playfair Display', a serif font that is used for titles and headers, adding a touch of elegance and formality to the design.
- Secondary font: 'Roboto', a clean sans-serif font, used for body text to ensure clarity and ease of reading.

This combination of colors and fonts creates a organized layout that not only enhances the user experience but also supports easy navigation through structured sections arranged by importance. This thoughtful design ensures a polished, professional look that holds the viewer’s attention and reinforces the content’s clarity.
